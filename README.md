# Hi, I’m Ainebyoona Godfrey

I’m a junior software developer from Kanungu, Uganda, and a first-year student at Metropolitan International University, Mbarara campus.

Despite coming from a humble background and working with just a phone, I’ve built several tech tools focused on **rural innovation**, **language inclusion**, and **social impact**.

## Projects I've Built
- **AI Tools for Rural Farmers** – multilingual support in 6 Ugandan languages  
- **Justice Assistant** – helping rural people access legal knowledge in local languages 
- **Local Dictionary App** – preserving and accessing native language vocabulary  
- **Proverb Generator** – sends culturally rich wisdom as daily notifications in runyankole rukiga 

I’m also actively working on:
- **Voice datasets** for underrepresented Ugandan languages  
- **Language-aware AI tools** for rural communities  
  
## My Mission
I believe rural communities deserve powerful, localized technology. I build for them because I come from them.

## Let’s Connect
I’m open to collaboration, mentorship, funding opportunities, or just sharing ideas around inclusive innovation and tech for Africa.I would appreciate an international community of young people.
